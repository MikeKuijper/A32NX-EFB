# A32NX Electronic Flight Bag

This is an attempt to create a platform for other developers to create 'modules' for the Fly By Wire A32NX Electronic Flight Bag. A lot of work still has to be done. Logo's are still basically non-existent, fonts could be refined and a lot of functionality has to be ported.

Current features:
* Module system for making apps
* Very basic web browser
* Settings parser for a centralised settings app
* Backbones of a tablet, such as header with accurate time and navigation

In the future:
I was planning on adding the current code of the EFB as a package, to make sure their work doesn't go to waste. That's about all I've got planned. Basic improvements and added functionality. Any ideas? I'm MikeK#7048 on Discord
